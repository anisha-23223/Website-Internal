            <p>Pop music is a type of popular music that many people like to listen to. The term "pop music" can be
                used for all kinds of music that was written to be popular. The term "pop music" was used from about
                1880 onwards, when new kinds of music became popular. Styles of pop music in the 2020s (today) include
                rock music, electronic dance music and hip hop. Different kinds of music are popular at different times,
                which changes the description.
                Modern pop music grew out of 1950s rock and roll, (for example Chuck Berry, Bo Diddley and Little
                Richard) and rockabilly (for example Elvis Presley and Buddy Holly). In the 1960s, The Beatles became a
                famous pop music group. In the 1970s, other styles of music were mixed with pop music, such as funk and
                soul music. Pop music generally has a heavy (strong) beat, so that it is good for dancing. Pop singers
                normally sing with microphones that are plugged into an amplifier and a loudspeaker.
                <br><br>
                There are also many more people working on pop music who are not seen on the stage or in the video.
                These people include the studio staff (people who help the musicians to record CDs and music videos in
                music studios), production staff (people who help make the music recordings sound good), distribution
                staff (people who help sell the music to stores) and retail staff (people that sell the music to people
                at CD stores).
                Tour staff help the band to travel around the country (or around the world) for their concert tours.
                Some tour staff help by carrying heavy musical instruments onto the stage. Other tour staff drive buses
                or cars, so that the band can get to the concert. Some tour staff operate sound equipment, such as the
                large amplifiers and loudspeakers that are used to amplify (make louder) the band's music for the
                audience.
                Promotional staff help to market or promote the band's music, so that more people will know about the
                band, and buy the band's CDs. Some promotional staff travel to radio stations and give the band's CD to
                radio station managers or DJs (disk jockeys: the people who announce songs on the radio). Other
                promotional staff write press releases (short articles) about the band which are sent to the newspapers.

                Pop music came from the Rock and Roll movement of the early 1950s, when record companies recorded songs
                that they thought that teenagers would like. Pop music usually uses musical from the other types of
                music that are popular at the time. Many different styles of music have become pop music during
                different time periods. Often, music companies create pop music styles by taking a style of music that
                only a small number of people were listening to, and then making that music more popular by marketing it
                to teenagers and young adults.
                In the 1950s, recording companies took blues-influenced rock and roll (for example Chuck Berry and Bo
                Diddley) and rockabilly (for example Carl Perkins and Buddy Holly) and promoted them as pop
                music. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, record companies took folk music bands and musicians and
                helped them to create a new type of music called folk rock or acid rock. Folk rock and acid rock mixed
                folk music, blues and rock and roll (for example The Byrds and Janis Joplin). In the 1970s, record
                companies created several harder, louder type of blues called blues rock or heavy metal, which became a
                type of pop music (for example the bands Led Zeppelin and Judas Priest).
                In the late 1970s and early 1980s, a type of nightclub dance music called Disco turned into a popular
                type of pop music. Record companies took an experimental, strange-sounding type of music called New Wave
                music from the 1980s and turned it into pop music bands such as The Cars. In the 1990s record companies
                took an underground type of hard rock called Grunge (for example the band Nirvana). Michael Jackson was
                also a very influential artist for pop music. His album, Thriller, is the best-selling album of all
                time. He also wrote some other very influential songs, such as "Bad", "Give In to Me", "Will You Be
                There", "Heal the World", "We Are the World", "Black or White", and "Billie Jean", just to name a few.
                By the 21st century (after the demise of disco in the 1980s) Contemporary R&B became pop music. Examples
                of Contemporary R&B artists that have a wide pop appeal are Usher, Beyonc√©, Rihanna, Chris Brown and
                more. Pop rappers Flo Rida and Kesha were mainstream in the late 2000s and the early 2010s. Modern pop
                singers include Ariana Grande, Katy Perry and Lady Gaga. Nicki Minaj blended pop and hip hop in the
                early 2010s.

                Many bands and artists are looked as influential in music history, but the English band The Beatles are
                the most looked upon band in history because of many of their songs being different types of pop and
                rock music (even metal and punk). Michael Jackson, The Bee Gees, Nirvana (band) are many of the artists
                and bands that look at The Beatles as a massive influence on their music.
